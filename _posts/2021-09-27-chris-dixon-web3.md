Chris Dixon has a [great thread](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201621266534402?s=21) on what Web 3.0 really is and why it matters. This is an area that I've been _*very*_ intrigued by for the past couple of months, particularly since Loot launched (another post I highly recommend is [this one](https://www.theverge.com/22655077/loot-social-network-open-source-nft) about Loot).

 Highly recommend it, and I anticipate I'll be sharing this forward quite often.
