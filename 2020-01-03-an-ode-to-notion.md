I've given [Notion](https://notion.so) two serious tries now, mostly because it does so much so well. Two things that stood out:
1. It's databse system with multiple "views" across Kanban and tables was a game changer for OKR prep, where we could have a single central repo and oages for each function.
2. Sharing links to Notion creates archived read it later pages which can be tagged, annotated and more pretty much as you wish. [Example.](https://www.notion.so/raveesh/Charlie-Munger-A-Lesson-on-Elementary-Worldly-Wisdom-c83e41282e5649938b07493950b94066)

Unfortunately, I'm yet to come across an app that is so close to perfection, yet throws it away due to the simple things. Namely, in Notion's case, performance and speed.

I really hope the folks at Notion crack this – it has all the potential to be a true knowledge center for a team that's actually usable – if, well, they make it usable. In many ways, rhis is what Confluence should be, with Native apps thrown in.

For now, I'm going to have to go back to my old workflow of notes all over the place (from Google Docs to markdown apps to post its) where I tend to lose things soon, but at least write them down for a while.
